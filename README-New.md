Script Objective
-----------------
Each of the 4 script generate a graph using the household power consumption dataset.

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

more about this dataset at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/


Preparation tasks
-----------------
You will need R to run this script. The script has been written with the concern to be run on any platform and use generic choices whenever possible. However development and testing was performed on the following platform:

* *Windows 8.0 US*
* *R Version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10)*

 The dataset is located at:
 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
    
The working directory refers to the working directory set in are. If want to use a different directory, set the working directory to the one you want to use before to use the script. This script expect the data sets to be located in your current directory:
1. Download the dataset
2. Unzip the dataset and copy it in your working directory
3. Download the script  "plot1.R" in your working directory
4. Download the script  "plot2.R" in your working directory
5. Download the script  "plot3.R" in your working directory
6. Download the script  "plot4.R" in your working directory

Every script will test if the dataset is present and will display an error message if missing.


Results
-------
4 files will be created in your working directory:

* plot1.png
* plot2.png
* plot3.png
* plot4.png
